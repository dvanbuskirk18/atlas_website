					<h1 id"map_title" class="upcase">Datascapes</h1>
					<p>The 'datascapes' are visualizations designed to make quantities which are otherwise hard to comprehend intelligible. Data manifested in the visualizations are generally based on the ecological footprint of an average American which, for polemical purposes, is then extrapolated to a hypothetical global population of 10 billion people living at the same (American) standard<sup id="one"><a href="#1"> 1</a></sup> . The reason for using the figure of 10 billion people is that it is a round number roughly mid-way between the latest UN global population projections which suggest a range between 9.5 and 13.3 billion people by 2100.<sup id="two"><a href="#2"> 2</a></sup></p>
					</p>
					<p>The datascapes show that if the world were to live (in material terms) as contemporary Americans do, there would be a major discrepancy between global levels of consumption and what the earth, according to today's technologies, can reasonably provide. The datascapes do not intend to be alarmist nor pass moral judgment on highly consumptive lifestyles. What they do make clear, however, is that as large numbers of people aspire to higher material standards of living throughout the 21st century, if ecological calamity is to be avoided, our systems of production and consumption will need to be better designed and better tuned to the earth's systems.

					</div>
					<p>The average American (2012 data) has an ecological footprint of 8.2 global hectares.<sup id="three"><a href="#3"> 3</a></sup> The Global Footprint Network defines a global hectare as "a biologically productive hectare with world average biological productivity for a given year. Global hectares are needed because different land types have different productivities."<sup id="four"><a href="#4"> 4</a></sup> Ten billion Americans will create a footprint of at least 82,000,000,000 gha. This is 670% of the Earthâ€™s current biological capacity of 12,243,512,050 gha.<sup id="five"><a href="#5"> 5</a></sup>
					</p>
					</br>
					
					<h3 id="biocapacity">National Biocapacity and Ecological Footprints</h3>
					<img src="images/Datascapes/1-person-per-year-CO2">
					<p>National biocapacity and ecological footprints are derived from data provided by the Global Footprint Network according to the productive area of land required to provide a society with its resources and absorb its waste. Biocapacity is a "measure of the amount of biologically productive land and sea area available to provide the ecosystem services that humanity consumes".<sup id="six"><a href="#6"> 6</a></sup>  Ecological footprints are a "measure of the demand populations and their activities place on the biosphere in a given year, given the prevailing technology and resource management."<sup id="seven"><a href="#7"> 7</a></sup> The total footprint is reached by adding data for food, energy, forest products, urban area and waste.
					</p>
					<p>In this datascape each nation's per capita biocapacity and per capita ecological footprint are superimposed upon one another to reveal the discrepancy (surplus or deficit) between the two. Where ecological footprints exceed biocapacity it means those nations draw resources from and distribute waste to regions beyond their own national territory. Where ecological footprints are within the biocapacity of the nation's territory it means that said nation is living within its means in terms of its national landscape. In an ideal and sustainable world all nations would have ecological footprints smaller than their biocapacity, but because nations are political not ecological units and because globalism enables the planetary distribution of resources, what ultimately matters is the relationship between the planet's total biocapacity and its total ecological footprint.
					</p>
					<p>The world's current (2012 data) ecological footprint is 20,114,439,677 global hectares and the planet's biological capacity in terms of our current methods of using resources is 12,243,512,050 global hectares.<sup id="eight"><a href="#8"> 8</a></sup> 
					</p>
					</br>

					<h3 id="carbon">Carbon Consumption and Emissions</h3>
					<p>An average American today (2012 data) produces 21.55 metric tons (47,510 lbs) of CO<sub>2</sub> equivalents a year.<sup id="nine"><a href="#9"> 9</a></sup> A world of 10 billion people at the material standard of today's average American  would therefore produce 216 billion metric tons of CO<sub>2</sub>, a pyramid of CO<sub>2</sub> equivalent<sup id="ten"><a href="#10"> 10</a></sup> in volume to 48 million the Great Pyramid of Giza. The charcoal spheres and the pyramid represent the volumes of CO<sub>2</sub> at normal temperature and atmosphere (NTP).<sup id="eleven"><a href="#11"> 11</a></sup>
					</p>
					</br>

					<h3 id="forest">Carbon Forest</h3>
					<p>A mature tree can absorb as much as 21.77 kg (48 lbs) of CO<sub>2</sub> a year, which means it would take about 990 such trees to sequester the carbon emissions of one average American.<sup id="twelve"><a href="#12"> 12</a></sup> The 216 billion metric tons of CO<sub>2</sub> emitted by a hypothetical global population of 10 billion such Americans would require 9.9 trillion trees to sequester its emissions.<sup id="thirteen"><a href="#13"> 13</a></sup> With a 3.65 m (12 ft) spacing between trees this equates to a 132,250,000 km<sup>2</sup> forest &mdash; almost the entire 149,000,000 km<sup>2</sup> terrestrial area of the planet (minus its current 15,000,000 km<sup>2</sup> of ice covered land). Discounting the 39,990,000 km<sup>2</sup> of the world's existing forest (including the world's protected areas) we are left with the need to construct a 92,260,000 km<sup>2</sup> forest in order to sequester the carbon emissions of the equivalent of 10 billion Americans.<sup id="fourteen"><a href="#14"> 14</a></sup>
					</p>
					<p>If we consider the feasibility of constructing such a forest, we must also subtract from this some 15,300,000 km<sup>2</sup> of current crop land and 33,800,000 km2 of current grazing land. (Although this grazing land has some tree cover it is not at the density required to meet the sequestration demand). Furthermore, we must also subtract the 26,780,400 km2 of potentially arable land which is not yet, but surely will be farmed if we are to feed 10 billion by 2100. This leaves a total of only 16,469,600 km<sup>2</sup> on which to develop a sequestration forest, all of which is presently desert. This is also assuming no expansion of the world's current grazing land. In short, as this century unfolds there will not be enough land to utilize forestry as the single mechanism for carbon sequestration.
					</p>
					<p>A 2015 Yale University study likewise attempted to calculate the scale of forest necessary to sequester future global carbon emissions. They calculate that, in addition to the 3 trillion existing trees, 6.9 trillion more trees would be needed to establish a global forest capable of sequestering the carbon emissions of 10 billion average contemporary Americans.<sup id="fifteen"><a href="#15"> 15</a></sup> The establishment of this forest would also need to counter the fact that, according to the same study, some 15 billion trees are cut down each year. In short, a world of 10 billion such people would need to double, if not triple, the current global forest in order to sequester their carbon emissions. Some overlaps between sequestration forestry and grazing land could occur, but the problem remains that forestry at the requisite density of tree cover to significantly sequester carbon and the land area needed for increased food production this century, are fundamentally at odds.
					</p>
					</br>

					<h3 id="energy">Energy Consumption</h3>
					<p>In 2012, the total American population of 314,112,078 people used 4,069,054,975,224 kWh of electricity a year.<sup id="sixteen"><a href="#16"> 16</a></sup> If this usage pattern were to stay the same 10 billion Americans would use 129,541,532,600,000 kWh a year. The amount of land required to produce this amount of electricity is shown for different types of power generation; nuclear,<sup id="seventeen"><a href="#17"> 17</a></sup> solar,<sup id="eighteen"><a href="#18"> 18</a></sup> and wind<sup id="nineteen"><a href="#19"> 19</a></sup> power at the scale such installations typically require.
					</p>
					</br>

					<h3 id="food">Foodscape</h3>
					<p>The earth's ice-free terrestrial area is 149,000,000 km<sup>2</sup>. According to the United Nation's Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), croplands in 2015 cover 15,300,000 km<sup>2</sup> (represented by the small square on the map) and pasture for animal grazing covers another 33,800,000 km<sup>2</sup>, a total of 49,100,000 km<sup>2</sup> (38% of the earth's ice-free land). Theoretically, there remains some 26,780,400 km<sup>2</sup> of land with potential for crop production worldwide.<sup id="twenty"><a href="#20"> 20</a></sup> Assuming all this land (represented by the middle square on the map) is under production by 2100 (as will be necessary to feed a global population of circa 10 billion) it would leave 75.8 million km<sup>2</sup> or 50% of the earth's ice free land for other uses &mdash; such as sequestration, evapotranspiration and biodiversity. If however grazing rangelands expand into this remaining 50% as would also be likely then its capacity to provide ecosystems services will reduce accordingly.
					</p>
					<p>However, into this calculation needs to be factored that 33% (49 million km<sup>2</sup>) of the earth's terrestrial surface is desert &mdash; by definition land unsuited to forestry and of limited biodiversity value. If we subtract the deserts from the equation, we are left with 40.2 million km<sup>2</sup> or 17% of the earth's ice-free terrestrial area precisely that which the Convention on Biological Diversity aims to secure by 2020.
					</p>
					<p>This breakdown of the global foodscape is based on reaching the limit of the world's remaining arable land. The other, more problematic way to approach it is to imagine that our hypothetical 10 billion people would, (if they could) consume what the average American does today.
					</p>
					<p>The average American requires 1.4 hectares of land for their total food requirements. 10 billion such consumers would therefore require 140.4 million km<sup>2</sup> of land for food production which is 93% of the earth's ice-free terrestrial surface (including land for crops and grazing according to current yields). In this case not only would all the world's arable land be used for agriculture but an additional 64 million km<sup>2</sup> (43%) would need to be converted to arable land, essentially the entirety of the world's deserts, plus some.  According to this breakdown a mere 7% of the earth's terrestrial surface would then be left for biodiversity &mdash; essentially a big zoo in the midst of a global monoculture of corn and cattle, much of it irrigated by desalination plants..
					</p>
					<p>Put another way, if the world's total arable land (not including expansion into deserts) were distributed evenly, each of 10 billion people would have 0.14 hectare-about four basketball courts-from which to survive.<sup id="twenty-one"><a href="#21"> 21</a></sup> By 2050 people in developed countries are predicted to consume food requiring almost triple this amount.<sup id="twenty-two"><a href="#22"> 22</a></sup>
					</p>
					</br>

					<h3 id="growth">Urban Growth</h3>
					<p>In calculating this datascape it was assumed that of the additional 3.9 billion people forecast to be added to the world's population by 2100, three billion of them will live in cities. To accommodate them the equivalent of 464 New York Cities (NYC) will need to be constructed in the next 84 years, at a steady rate this is 5.5 per annum.<sup id="twenty-three"><a href="#23"> 23</a></sup> Whilst this illustration reveals the sheer mass of historically unprecedented construction taking place, the image of New York is misleading for much of the world's urban growth is in informal settlements in Africa and South and Central America. The Urban Growth datascape shows the urban footprint of three billion people at four different typologies: 1) hyper density (NYC)<sup id="twenty-four"><a href="#24"> 24</a></sup>, high density informal settlement (Mumbai)<sup id="twenty-five"><a href="#25"> 25</a></sup>, medium density (Barcelona)<sup id="twenty-six"><a href="#26"> 26</a></sup>, and suburban density (Los Angeles)<sup id="twenty-seven"><a href="#27"> 27</a></sup>.

							<h3>Zhao Renhui (The Institute of Critical Zoologists)</h3>
							<p>This section of the Atlas showcases the photography of Singaporean artist Zhao Renhui, Director of the Institute for Critical Zoologists, from his 2013 artwork <a target="_blank" href="http://criticalzoologists.org/guide/">Guide to the Flora and Fauna of the World</a><sup id="one"><a href="#1"> 1</a></sup>. <!--These works seek to document and reflect on the myriad ways in which human action and intervention have and continue to alter the natural world.--> The guide presents a catalogue of curious creatures and life-forms that have evolved in often unexpected ways to cope with the stresses and pressures of a changed world.
							</p>
							<p class="last_para">Organisms documented in the series are the results of human intervention, mutations engineered to serve various interests and purposes ranging from economics to aesthetics. Some specimens in this project are based on fact, while others are based on proposals, hypotheses, and papers written by scientists. The line between these two is often an indistinct one, as scientific advances within the last half-century have made possible what was previously believed to be impossible. While drawing on the basic human desire to catalogue and to order knowledge so as to better understand (and command) the world, the project also questions the limits of these systems by blurring the lines between fact and fiction, and oscillating between the modalities of science and art. Through his photography Renhui captures the pathos of the Anthropocene.

						    	<p>China organised the first International Goldfish Championships in Fuzhou in 2012. Over 3,000 goldfish from 14 countries competed for different titles including the World Goldfish Queen crown. Goldfish are judged by five criteria: breed, body shape, swimming gesture, colour and overall impression. The show stealer was a giant goldfish weighing around 4kg. The judges noted that not all goldfish can grow this big as factors such as breeding may affect size. Goldfish are bred out of generations of genetic mutations since the Jin Dynasty and their exact origins are unknown.</p>

						    	<p>Flowerhorn cichlids are ornamental aquarium fish noted for their vivid colours and bulbous humped heads. A manmade hybrid, the flowerhorn was popular in Singapore in the late 1990s. When their popularity waned, owners released the fish into the local waters. Today, the fish thrive in large numbers in local reservoirs and waterways. Scientists have reported that the flowerhorn has taken on a different adaptation in recent years. The bulbous and round head it once had has given way to a sharp, flat and rounded disc. It is posited that the more streamlined form allows them to swim quickly away from predators.</p>

Many male birds have also been found dead along the highways during mating season. Scientists believe that they died from singing exhaustion, as noise from the highway obscures their mating calls. Birds have also been found to die from shock around construction sites &mdash; sudden loud noises have literally caused these birds to drop from the sky.</p>

In recent years, diurnal birds have also been found dead as a result of flying into brightly lit towers. Whole flocks have also been reported to collide with buildings. Diurnal birds are often woken up by sudden loud noises, causing them to fly in confusion towards these bright lights as they believe dawn has arrived.</p>

The insects are usually killed by exhaustion or through contact with the heat from lamps. After being incinerated, their bodies become a heap of ash, collected in the covers of street lamps. The ash, also referred to as 'moon dust', is used by scientists to study the ecological impact of light pollution on insects.</p>

Though small, Asian tiger mosquitoes bite aggressively and can spread more than 100 diseases. Originally from East Asia, the tiger mosquito has spread widely in the last two decades. In Europe, the mosquitoes have also adapted to live through the harsh winters.

A combination of factors such as a lack of trees in new reclaimed spaces made mostly of sand and large flat areas meant that the original black crow became less camouflaged. Another possible reason was that the crows adapted to the heat from the large sand masses by turning light-coloured as normal crows with black coats would overheat. A chance white mutation could have triggered off the adaptation. When land reclamation slowed down, the white crows started to disappear</p>

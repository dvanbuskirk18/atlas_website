	<p>On May 20, 1570, Abraham Ortelius, book collector and engraver from Antwerp, published the <i>Theatrum Orbis Terrarum</i> (Epitome of the Theater of the World), the world's first atlas.<sup> 3</sup> It laid bare a world of healthy ecoregions, ripe for colonization and exploitation. Some 450 years later this <i>Atlas for the End of the World</i> is a survey of what's left.</p>

	<p>At face value atlases are just collections of maps and in that regard this one is no different. The maps in this collection are however quite specific. They show the difference between the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) Aichi target for achieving 17% global (terrestrial and inland water areas) protected habitat by 2020 and what is actually protected in the world’s 35 biodiversity hotspots today (2015)<sup> 4</sup>. Hotspots are by definition the richest and most threatened biologically diverse regions on earth.<sup> 5</sup></p>

	<p>After each hotspot map condensed statistical information for the 144 nations who have sovereign jurisdiction over the hotspots is also provided. This data ranks these nations' levels of environmental performance, the status of their national biodiversity planning, their biocapacity relative to their ecological footprint and their respective levels of perceived corruption.</p>

	<p>Each hotspot is then further examined at the level of its constituent ecoregions, each of which is assessed in relation to the 17% protected area target. In addition to this 'conflict maps' show the relationship between protected areas, land-use and urbanization in each hotspot. From the conflict maps each city with a population of 300,000 or more (a total of 420 cities across the 35 hotspots) is mapped in terms of its projected growth to the year 2030, revealing in broad terms where this growth is on a collision course with endangered species and remnant habitat.</p>

	<p>Supplementing the main subject of the hotspots, the atlas also offers a series of world maps constructed from secondary sources. These provide information relevant to global conservation and the epoch of the Anthropocene more broadly. The atlas also includes a small set of 'datascapes' – graphic representations of quantities (for example the world's carbon emissions) which are otherwise hard to comprehend. The atlas concludes with a selection of photography titled 'Guide to the Flora and Fauna of the World' from the Singaporean artist and nominal head of the 'Institute of Critical Zoology', Zhao Renhui.</p>

	<p>An introductory essay, directly following this précis, explains the rationale of the atlas through various lenses and although it makes most sense when read from beginning to end, the text is subdivided for readers of a non-linear persuasion. If you have no time for all this, and want 'just the facts' then see the section named exactly that.</p>

	<p>The findings of this research project are threefold: first, a majority of the ecoregions in the hotspots fall well short of United Nations' 2020 targets for protected lands; second, many cities in the hotspots are projected to continue to sprawl in an unregulated manner into the world’s most valuable habitats; and finally, only a small number of the 196 nations who are party to the CBD (and the 144 nations who have sovereign jurisdiction over the hotspots) have any semblance of appropriately scaled, land use planning which would help reconcile international conservation values with local economic imperatives.<sup> 6</sup></p>

	<p>By focusing attention on the hotspots in the lead-up to the UN's 2020 deadline for achieving the Aichi targets, this atlas is intended as a geopolitical tool to help prioritize conservation in land-use planning. It is also a call to landscape architects, urban designers, and planners to become more involved in helping reconcile ecology and economics in these territories. Set diametrically at the opposite end of modernity to Ortelius' original, this atlas promotes cultivation, not conquest.</p>

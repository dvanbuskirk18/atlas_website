					<p>With cities now networked globally and dependent upon the earth system of the Anthropocene the expression 'planetary urbanization' to describe this latest phase of the evolution of the city seems apt. The expression announces the transition of the city from its historical incarnation as primarily a series of discrete entities to its current condition as a global network of relations riven through the planet's ecological resources. So understood, the city is no longer something distinguishable from 'nature': it is a new nature.
					</p>
					<p>Having now reached the ends of the earth and altered the earth system's basic metabolic functions we are now living in what may well be the penultimate phase of the evolution of the city. On the one hand, planetary urbanization will prove on a global scale that the city has been a fundamentally unsustainable phenomenon all along. On the other, because it is increasingly subject to environmental feedback and intelligent design, planetary urbanization can be thought of as yet to reach its maturation as an ecologically integrated system.

						<p>A mature tree can absorb as much as 21.77 kg (48 lbs) of CO<sub>2</sub> a year, which means it would take about 990 such trees to sequester the carbon emissions of one average American.<sup id="one"><a href="#1"> 1</a></sup> The 216 billion metric tons of CO<sub>2</sub> emitted by a hypothetical global population of 10 billion such Americans would require 9.9 trillion trees to sequester its emissions.<sup id="two"><a href="#2"> 2</a></sup> With a 3.65 m (12 ft) spacing between trees this equates to a 132,250,000 km<sup>2</sup> forest &mdash; almost the entire 149,000,000 km<sup>2</sup> terrestrial area of the planet (minus its current 15,000,000 km<sup>2</sup> of ice covered land). Discounting the 39,990,000 km<sup>2</sup> of the world's existing forest (including the world's protected areas) we are left with the need to construct a 92,260,000 km<sup>2</sup> forest in order to sequester the carbon emissions of the equivalent of 10 billion Americans.<sup id="three"><a href="#3"> 3</a></sup>
						</p>
						<p class="last_para">If we consider the feasibility of constructing such a forest, we must also subtract from this some 15,300,000 km<sup>2</sup> of current crop land and 33,800,000 km2 of current grazing land. (Although this grazing land has some tree cover it is not at the density required to meet the sequestration demand). Furthermore, we must also subtract the 26,780,400 km2 of potentially arable land which is not yet, but surely will be farmed if we are to feed 10 billion by 2100. This leaves a total of only 16,469,600 km<sup>2</sup> on which to develop a sequestration forest, all of which is presently desert. This is also assuming no expansion of the world's current grazing land. In short, as this century unfolds there will not be enough land to utilize forestry as the single mechanism for carbon sequestration.
						</p>
						<!--<p>A 2015 Yale University study likewise attempted to calculate the scale of forest necessary to sequester future global carbon emissions. They calculate that, in addition to the 3 trillion existing trees, 6.9 trillion more trees would be needed to establish a global forest capable of sequestering the carbon emissions of 10 billion average contemporary Americans.<sup id="fifteen"><a href="#15"> 15</a></sup> The establishment of this forest would also need to counter the fact that, according to the same study, some 15 billion trees are cut down each year. In short, a world of 10 billion such people would need to double, if not triple, the current global forest in order to sequester their carbon emissions. Some overlaps between sequestration forestry and grazing land could occur, but the problem remains that forestry at the requisite density of tree cover to significantly sequester carbon and the land area needed for increased food production this century, are fundamentally at odds.

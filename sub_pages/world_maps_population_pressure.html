					<p>This map shows global population dynamics over two timeframes. The background color of the world's nations shows the rate of migration from rural areas to cities from 1990 projected to 2050. The color intensity of the circles (indicating the location and size of cities), shows the rate of growth of the given city from 1990 projected to 2030. Essentially, this map shows the global phenomenon of migration to cities and registers the intensity of that migration.</p>
					<p>In 2015 the global population was circa 7.3 billion people. The United Nations forecasts that this will grow to 8.5 billion in 2030, 9.7 billion in 2050, 11.2 billion in 2100. The UN reports that there is 95% certainty that global population will be between 9.5 and 13.3 billion in 2100 and a 23% chance that it will stabilize of fall before 2100. If say 3.0 billion of these addition 3.9 billion people come to live in cities it means the equivalent of 464 New York Cities are required. In terms of sheer construction, this means building 5.5 New Yorks per year, between now and 2100. Because starting entirely new cities in new locations is expensive and because existing cities tend to resist densification, we can expect much of this new global development to be what is pejoratively known as sprawl. Because most of the growth is occurring and is expected to continue in Africa it will not take the form of North American suburban sprawl or social housing as one finds in New York, rather, the growth will be informal and self organized.
					</p>
					<p>With the need to source energy, food, water and housing for an extra 3.9 billion people in the midst of intensifying climate change this century is likely to see competition for resources between people and between species take place on a scale like no other. As pressure increases in Africa and South America, 48 countries, predominantly in Europe are now experiencing shrinking populations. Whether these nations can or should help relieve pressure in other parts of the world by opening their borders or boosting their immigration quotas is vexed.
					</p>
					<p>Zooming out, this century (or early in the next) presents the prospect that global population growth will approach stability and begin to decline. This would  bring to an end a growth cycle which began when a global population of circa 4 million nomads started to transition into settlements with the birth of the agricultural revolution. The critical question is whether the earthâ€™s ecosystem can be managed so that it will be able to absorb the total pressure of 11.2 billion people, all of whom will aspire to high standards of living.

						<h3>Where to From Here? And SEEDS: Systemic, ecological and economic design strategies</h3>
						<!--<div w3-include-html='include/precis_text.html'></div>-->
						<p>This Atlas has set out territories in which the world's most unique biodiversity faces imminent extinction because of unplanned land use and urban growth. <!--It serves as a precursor to and argument for the urgent application of design and planning intelligence to these territories. This intelligence takes the form of interdisciplinary teams (SEEDS) of landscape architects, ecologists, and economists being embedded in the world’s 35 hotspots with a mandate to establish relationships, conduct research, determine exemplar projects and then produce planning and policy documents to guide the practical realization of those projects. This, we believe, will serve as a catalyst for bringing the oftentimes oppositional interests of global and local cultures, as well as conservation and development interests together.</p>--> Whilst these territories are well known by local communities and by certain economic and conservation interest groups, there is a lack of planning and design intelligence working in the field between the three. In many parts of the developed world the profession of landscape architecture has proven that it can reduce, if not completely reconcile the conflict between development, community and conservation and it is high time those skills were extended to the territories of the world’s biological hotspots.
						</p>
						<p>As we approach the final years of the United Nation's Decade of Biodiversity the SEEDS initiative is a call to bring environmental scientists, economists, landscape architects and local communities together as part of a concerted and properly funded international effort to focus on the hotspots; to firstly gather lessons already learned in these territories, then holistically analyze the major urban growth and land use dynamics taking place and then determine and design exemplary demonstration projects. In some cases, this might mean assisting governments develop their large scale, long term National Biodiversity Strategy Action Plans (NBSAPs), in others it might mean selecting very specific places for detailed design interventions.
						</p>
						<p>Starting in 2018 the 35 SEEDS will each work for 2 years in their respective territories and present their results at a major international forum in 2020 &mdash; the final year of the United Nation's Decade on Biodiversity.</p>

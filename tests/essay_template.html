					<h3>The Atlas</h3>
					<p>On May 20, 1570, Antwerp book collector and engraver Abraham Ortelius published Theatrum Orbis Terrarum (Epitome of the Theater of the World), the world's first atlas. Capturing the explorative spirit of the age and lauded for its unprecedented rigor and organization, the Theatrum was a best seller. Giving definitive shape to an otherwise anecdotal and imaginary new world, the Theatrum drew its power and authority from mapping's implicit association with accuracy and objectivity. But as history attests, maps are notorious liars.</p>
					<p>The Theatrum's frontispiece was anything but objective. Five female figures make up the scene: civilized, Christian Europa sits atop in control, Africa and Asia both seductive decorate the flanks and the naked Americas reclining in relative darkness beneath, holding the cannibal's trophy, a decapitated head. A bust of a fifth figure representing (virgin) lands not yet discovered is to her right. Indeed, while much of the world was known in crude outline in 1570, a great south land (Australia) remained hypothetical, as did much of the interior landscape of Asia, Africa and the Americas. We now know that in-between the lines of Ortelius' engravings indigenous people the world over knew their landscapes intimately. Indigenous Australians, for example, had been mapping that continent in great detail for millennia and yet upon 'discovery' the British conveniently described it as terra nullius (literally, nobody's land).</p>
					<p>It is estimated that the pre-urban world sustained around four million nomads. Their small populations, their light-footedness, benign technologies and animist theologies resulted in the comparatively steady environmental state we now idealize as 'sustainability.'</p>
					<p>The agricultural revolutions (occurring more or less simultaneously, circa 10,000 BC, in the flood plains of the Tigris, Euphrates, Indus and Huangho rivers), however, began a very different and ultimately global land-use dynamic that continues to this day. As villages and cities incubated larger settled populations, the radius of land clearance and food production necessarily expanded, so much so that our foodbowls now reach to the ends of the earth.</p>
					<p>In 1570 the European imagination could literally run wild with whatever might be 'out there,' now, a mere 450 years later that vast mysterious world is now inextricably colonized and irreversibly altered by the material and conceptual forces of modernity. Whereas Ortelius marked out modernity's territorial beginnings, by focusing on the remaining habitat in the world's 35 biodiversity hotspots, by definition places with unique and threatened biodiversity this Atlas now rakes over the remains.</p>
					<p>And yet, this Atlas has territorial ambitions of its own. As such this is not, as advertised, about the end of the world at all, for that cosmological inevitability awaits the sun's explosion still some billions of years away. It is about the end of Ortelius' world, the end of the world as a naive and unlimited stage for human expansion and exploitation. On this, even the Catholic Church is now adamant: "we have no such right" writes Pope Francis.</p>
					<p>Before explaining how this Atlas works, there is another to which we must also turn for inspiration. Published two years after the Theatrum Orbis Terrarum (1572) and conceived as a companion text was the Civitates Orbis Terrarum, a six-volume Atlas of 450 (almost entirely European) cities edited by George Braum and engraved by Frans Hogenberg. The Civitates is a taxonomy of medieval and renaissance urbanism – a world without sprawl. Walled in and gathered tightly around their vital fluids, all the cities in Civitates cling to the contours of what appear to us now as idyllic agrarian landscapes. Huddled together, all the buildings lie low and defer to their cathedrals – a reminder that the life forms we now value under the rubric of ecology were then much lower on the ladder of creation. While all these cities looked inward and upward, as the architect Rem Koolhaas explains in his foreword to the 2008 reprint, they in fact stood at the edge of "the future chaos the centrifugal forces of globalization will unleash." Half a millennium later Koolhaas writes, "our cities have become monstrous, too endless to represent, endlessly complicated [and] largely dysfunctional." He should have also said ecologically catastrophic. </p>

					<h3>Planetary Urbanism</h3>
					<p>Writing in 2011, theorists of urbanization Neil Brenner and Christian Schmid describe that which for Koolhaas was "too endless to represent" as "planetary urbanization" and depending on your worldview it is either the apotheosis or the nadir of urban evolution. For Brenner and Schmid it means "that even spaces that lie well beyond the traditional city cores and suburban peripheries - from transoceanic shipping lanes, transcontinental highway and railway networks, and worldwide communication infrastructures to alpine and coastal tourist enclaves, 'nature' parks, off shore financial centers, agro industrial catchment zones and erstwhile 'natural' spaces such as the world's oceans, deserts jungles mountain ranges, tundra, and atmosphere—have become integral parts of the world wide urban fabric."</p>
					<p>This conception of contemporary global urbanization emerges from and bears witness to the dissolution of the longstanding boundary between city and country, a boundary that the engravings in the Civitates so assiduously trace. With the dissolution of the urban- rural interface the dualism of Culture (in here, city, mind) and Nature (out there, landscape, animal), which provided Cartesian modernity with its epistemological raison d’etre, becomes untenable. Consequently, in the late 20th and early 21st century 'nature writing' has been replaced by 'end of nature' writing.</p>				
					<p>The nature this writing says has ended is nature as pure other. But as one nature ends another always begins and so, printed on the back cover of this book is an alternative title: Atlas for the Beginning of the Anthropocene. Anthropogenic nature is not other to us, it is us. Reaching from the scale of the single cell to the lithosphere of the entire planet, Anthropogenic nature is at once a hybrid of technological and organic systems. In terms of landscape it is what the ecological community politely refer to as novel ecology. It is what Brenner and Schmid refer to as planetary urbanism.</p>
					<p>Although not yet officially recognized by the Geological Society of London (where such things are still solemnly adjudicated), the idea of the Anthropocene as originally conceived by atmospheric chemist Paul Crutzen - that we have entered a new geological era, one in which humans are acting on such a scale as to have now become a primary determinant of the earth's ongoing physiology - is broadly accepted. This achievement puts us on an evolutionary level with cyanobacteria (single celled bacteria), which over the course of two billion years mindlessly converted a hydrogen rich atmosphere to oxygen and made what we now enjoy as life possible but in so doing brought about their own demise.</p>
					<p>Since the beginning of the industrial revolution, if not the agricultural revolution, our contribution to the cosmic mix has been carbon - lots of carbon. Where carbon-induced climate change will ultimately lead is the stuff of speculation, but to be sure plants and animals, as well as many humans who are unable to modify their environments, will be on the move to higher ground and cooler climes. For species that cannot construct artificial environments the fact is "move or die". But you can't move if there is nothing to move into. Preparing pathways and destinations for species migrations therefore requires the restructuring of our landscapes on a vast scale.</p>
					<p>The Anthropocene is not just an historical register of the scale of human impact on the environment; it signifies a philosophical and practical terminus in the evolution of culture. It means that we are now self-aware at the species level that we have remade the world on our own (quite probably mistaken) terms, and in doing so we are now - even if only out of continued self-interest - thoroughly implicated in its short- and long-term continuation as a viable place in which to live.</p>

				<div id='stewardship'>
					<h3>Stewardship</h3>
					<p>Ortelius' world was one from which incipient modern man could take with impunity. The Anthropocene on the other hand is one in which everything comes with ecological debt. As the theologian and environmentalist Thomas Berry once said, the earth "is a faithful scribe, a faultless calculator [and] a superb bookkeeper." In order to survive it, the new world of the Anthropocene is above all one we must carefully manage. As geographer Erle Ellis (whose work to map anthropogenic biomes is featured on page xxx), explains, we must now work toward "maintaining, enhancing and restoring the ecological functions of the remnant, recovering, and managed novel ecosystems formed by land use and its legacies within the complex multifunctional anthropogenic landscape mosaics that are the predominant form of terrestrial ecosystems today and into the future."</p>					
					<p>And while this turn to stewardship could well be an ennobling historical project providing humanity with the existential purpose of the gardener, James Lovelock whose own 'Gaian' theory of life has done much to popularize new ecocentric world views, is more circumspect: "[i]t takes a lot of hubris to even to think of ourselves as stewards of the earth. Do we want the remote and infinitely difficult task of managing the earth? Do we want to be made accountable for its health...? I would sooner expect a goat to succeed as a gardener than expect humans to become stewards of the earth. There can be no worse fate for people than to conscript them to such a hopeless task.” Lovelock’s description of stewardship’s impossibility is a dystopian ploy to shock us into temperance so as to avoid further climate change. In any event, with atmospheric carbon levels now exceeding 400 parts per million, a global population expected to peak at circa 10 billion sometime this century, and an ecosystem in triage, it would seem we have no choice but to engage in some form of both locally and globally coordinated stewardship. The question is, to what degree those actions will be precautionary or simply reactive. Lovelock does express some faith in human agency when he writes in his 1988 biography of the planet, The Ages of Gaia, that in order to solve our global problems “we need a general practitioner of planetary medicine.”</p>
					<p>These general practitioners are known professionally as landscape architects. Landscape architecture has produced some of history’s most beautiful mediations of the relationship between humanity and the environment. Achieving what music does for noise, gardens such as Villa d-este outside Rome, Vaux le Vicomte outside Paris, Stowe in Buckinghamshire and the Summer Palace in Beijing have exquisitely expressed humanity’s deepest desire for orientation and physical well being within the natural order of things. As the British liked to think, such works of art ‘improved nature’. However, when motivated by profit instead of beauty and unleashed outside the garden wall improvements become monstrosities.</p>
					<p>Since the industrial revolution landscape architecture has shied away from the brutal front-lines of modernity and made its peace with the world primarily through the provision of public space for congested urban populations, the piece de resistance being of course Central Park in New York City (1858). It’s author, Frederick Law Olmsted (1882- 1903) (along with Calvert Vaux, 1824-1895) not only imported landscape scenery into urban environments right across America, he also did much to preserve it beyond. By virtue of creating faux nature inside the city and advocating for National Parks outside, the alarming depravity of modern industrial culture could, it was hoped, be redeemed. As one of its first commissioners, Olmsted was central to the creation and ‘design’ of Yosemite National park, which - along with Yellowstone became an influential precursor to the modern version of landscapes in which pristine nature was venerated and human activity restrained.</p>		
					<p>With Olmsted as its founding father, Landscape architecture in the 20th century assumed a global mandate and mission of stewardship when in 1960 Ian McHarg, Chair of Landscape Architecture at the University of Pennsylvania published his manifesto “Design With Nature”. McHarg counters Lovelock’s pessimism declaring that: “[i]f one can view the biosphere as a single superorganism, then ... man is an enzyme capable of its regulation, and conscious of it. He (sic) is of the system and entirely dependent upon it but has the responsibility for management, derived from apperception. This is his role—steward of the biosphere and its consciousness.” Railing against Judeo-Christian narratives of dominion McHarg argues that humanity in general and landscape architects in particular should correct history and shape all infrastructure and urban growth in accordance with the foundational principles of landscape ecology forthwith.</p>
					<p>And yet, since McHarg produced his manifesto of stewardship and the profession of landscape architecture has dutifully grown around the world, it could hardly be said that the world is ecologically a better place. Certainly patches of landscape in the post-industrial developed world have been ‘improved’ over the course of the last 50 years and some of that is down to landscape architects and the interdisciplinary teams they lead, but in general the world’s biodiversity; water, soil and air quality has markedly declined. Over the same timeframe the popular culture of environmentalism and the global conservation movement has fanned out around the world to ‘save’ what it can. In 1970 just as McHarg’s ‘Design with Nature’ hit the shelves there was a global total of c 2.5 million km2 of protected areas. By 2014 the United Nations Environment Program’s Protected Area Report records a grand total of 32.6 million km 2 (20.6 million km 2 of terrestrial and 12 million marine) . Under the rubric of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) the major conservation NGO’s (xx xxxx) Conservation International (CI), The Nature Conservancy (TNC), The Worldwide Fund for Nature (WWF), The African Wildlife Foundation (AWF) and The Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) along with their local partners and networks of donors can duly take credit for creating what is the world’s first planetary park. For the first time in history humans are trying to reverse engineer paradise on a massive scale.

					<h3>The Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD)</h3>
					<p>The overarching framework for this global landscape preservation and restoration project is the United Nations Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011–2020. The key mechanisms of this plan are brokered and administered through the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), one of the three 'Rio Conventions', emerging from the UN Conference on Environment and Development (the 'Earth Summit') held in Rio de Janeiro in 1992. The primary objective of the CBD is that "[by] 2050, biodiversity is valued, conserved, restored and wisely used, maintaining ecosystem services, sustaining a healthy planet and delivering benefits essential for all people". There are currently 194 Parties to the Convention (193 countries and the European Union). Only Andora, Iraq, Somalia, Brunei, and East Timor are not.</p>
					<p>Most importantly the Conference of the Parties, held from 18 to 29 October 2010, in Nagoya, Aichi Prefecture, Japan, adopted a revised and updated Strategic Plan for Biodiversity, including the Aichi Biodiversity Targets, for the 2011-2020 period. The Parties agreed to translate the Aichi Targets into revised and updated national biodiversity strategies and action plans (NBSAPs). There are 5 strategic goals (A-E) and 20 (1-20) targets in the Aichi Targets and they are well worth reiterating in full.</p>			
					<h4>A. Address the underlying causes of biodiversity loss by mainstreaming biodiversity across government and society.</h4>
					<h4>Target 1</h4>				
					<p>By 2020, at the latest, people are aware of the values of biodiversity and the steps they can take to conserve and use it sustainably.</p>		
					<h4>Target 2</h4>			
					<p>By 2020, at the latest, biodiversity values have been integrated into national and local development and poverty reduction strategies and planning processes and are being incorporated into national accounting, as appropriate, and reporting systems.</p>				
					<h4>Target 3</h4>			
					<p>By 2020, at the latest, incentives, including subsidies, harmful to biodiversity are eliminated, phased out or reformed in order to minimize or avoid negative impacts, and positive incentives for the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity are developed and applied, consistent and in harmony with the Convention and other relevant international obligations, taking into account national socio economic conditions.</p>
					<h4>Target 4</h4>			
					<p>By 2020, at the latest, Governments, business and stakeholders at all levels have taken steps to achieve or have implemented plans for sustainable production and consumption and have kept the impacts of use of natural resources well within safe ecological limits.</p>		
					<h4>B. Reduce the pressures on biodiversity and promote sustainable use.</h4>
					<h4>Target 5</h4>
					<p>By 2020, the rate of loss of all natural habitats, including forests, is at least halved and where feasible brought close to zero, and degradation and fragmentation is significantly reduced.</p>				
					<h4>Target 6</h4>			
					<p>By 2020 all fish and invertebrate stocks and aquatic plants are managed and harvested sustainably, legally and applying ecosystem based approaches, so that overfishing is avoided, recovery plans and measures are in place for all depleted species, fisheries have no significant adverse impacts on threatened species and vulnerable ecosystems and the impacts of fisheries on stocks, species and ecosystems are within safe ecological limits.</p>		
					<h4>Target 7</h4>				
					<p>By 2020 areas under agriculture, aquaculture and forestry are managed sustainably, ensuring conservation of biodiversity.</p>		
					<h4>Target 8</h4>					
					<p>By 2020, pollution, including from excess nutrients, has been brought to levels that are not detrimental to ecosystem function and biodiversity.</p>				
					<h4>Target 9</h4>				
					<p>By 2020, invasive alien species and pathways are identified and prioritized, priority species are controlled or eradicated, and measures are in place to manage pathways to prevent their introduction and establishment.</p>
					<h4>Target 10</h4>				
					<p>By 2015, the multiple anthropogenic pressures on coral reefs, and other vulnerable ecosystems impacted by climate change or ocean acidification are minimized, so as to maintain their integrity and functioning.</p>				
					<h4>C. Improve the status of biodiversity by safeguarding ecosystems, species and genetic diversity.</h4>
					<h4>Target 11</h4>
					<p>By 2020, at least 17 per cent of terrestrial and inland water, and 10 per cent of coastal and marine areas, especially areas of particular importance for biodiversity and ecosystem services, are conserved through effectively and equitably managed, ecologically representative and well connected systems of protected areas and other effective area-based conservation measures, and integrated into the wider landscapes and seascapes.</p>
					<h4>Target 12</h4>			
					<p>By 2020 the extinction of known threatened species has been prevented and their conservation status, particularly of those most in decline, has been improved and sustained.</p>		
					<h4>Target 13</h4>				
					<p>By 2020, the genetic diversity of cultivated plants and farmed and domesticated animals and of wild relatives, including other socio-economically as well as culturally valuable species, is maintained, and strategies have been developed and implemented for minimizing genetic erosion and safeguarding their genetic diversity.</p>			
					<h4>D. Enhance the benefits to all from biodiversity and ecosystems services.</h4>
					<h4>Target 14</h4>
					<p>By 2020, ecosystems that provide essential services, including services related to water, and contribute to health, livelihoods and well-being, are restored and safeguarded, taking into account the needs of women, indigenous and local communities, and the poor and vulnerable.</p>
					<h4>Target 15</h4>			
					<p>By 2020, ecosystem resilience and the contribution of biodiversity to carbon stocks has been enhanced, through conservation and restoration, including restoration of at least 15 per cent of degraded ecosystems, thereby contributing to climate change mitigation and adaptation and to combating desertification.</p>
					<h4>Target 16</h4>			
					<p>By 2015, the Nagoya Protocol on Access to Genetic Resources and the Fair and Equitable Sharing of Benefits Arising from their Utilization is in force and operational, consistent with national legislation.</p>	
					<h4>E. Enhance implementation through participatory planning, knowledge management and capacity building.</h4>						
					<h4>Target 17</h4>					
					<p>By 2015 each Party has developed, adopted as a policy instrument, and has commenced implementing an effective, participatory and updated national biodiversity strategy and action plan.</p>
					<h4>Target 18</h4>				
					<p>By 2020, the traditional knowledge, innovations and practices of indigenous and local communities relevant for the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity, and their customary use of biological resources, are respected, subject to national legislation and relevant international obligations, and fully integrated and reflected in the implementation of the Convention with the full and effective participation of indigenous and local communities, at all relevant levels.</p>
					<h4>Target 19</h4>			
					<p>By 2020, knowledge, the science base and technologies relating to biodiversity, its values, functioning, status and trends, and the consequences of its loss, are improved, widely shared and transferred, and applied.</p>
					<h4>Target 20</h4>			
					<p>By 2020, at the latest, the mobilization of financial resources for effectively implementing the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020 from all sources, and in accordance with the consolidated and agreed process in the Strategy for Resource Mobilization, should increase substantially from the current levels. This target will be subject to changes contingent to resource needs assessments to be developed and reported by Parties.</p>

					<h3>Landscape Architecture</h3>
					<p>According to the CBD meeting the Aichi Biodiversity Targets is not just about biodiversity as an isolated issue. Biodiversity, they argue, is connected to global development goals such “reducing hunger and poverty, improving human health, ensuring a sustainable supply of energy, food and clean water, contributing to climate-change mitigation and adaptation, combating desertification and land degradation, and reducing vulnerability to disasters.” All these issues are complex and involve all levels of society but one thing they all have in common is that at root they manifest in land- use practices and take spatial, landscape forms: They are then landscape architectural issues.</p>
					<p>
					To help deal logically with the complexity of the landscape Ian McHarg developed a method of mapping the biophysical characteristics of a given landscape so as to determine the most suitable land-use. The method brings the layers of landscape ecology (geology, soils, hydrology, vegetation, etc.) to the fore as the primary determinant of the type and form of land- use. The method is now practiced routinely through Geographic Information System (GIS) mapping as a mechanism for guiding development decisions so that they are tuned to the patterns and dynamics of landscape ecology. With such tools and through their generalist training in both the arts and natural sciences, landscape architects are skilled at using these and other methods to create scenarios for alternative short and long-term futures. The future toward which all their work is directed is one in which ecology and economy are reconciled. At least that's the theory.</p>
					<p>
					In reality, while GIS related planning techniques enable the broad-scale and instrumental application of global conservation values, such top-down methods lack the specificity necessary to truly ground those values in the ever-changing ecological and cultural complexity of real places. To achieve that, McHarg’s “good steward” has to become deeply immersed in a given place, or at least work closely with people who are. In other words, the global overview of the planner is nothing without the grassroots knowledge of the gardener.</p>
					<p>		
					McHarg struggled against the trivialization of his profession as glorified gardening, but the biologist Daniel Janzen uses the metaphor of the garden to good effect when he argues that wildlands must now be conceptualized as such. For Janzen the metaphor of the garden, if not its Judeo-Christian allegory, is useful because it pulls wildlands out of “exclusion unto extinction” as he puts it, and places them into the very heart of culture. The garden metaphor confers on wildlands all the “care, planning, investment, zoning, insurance, fine-tuning, research, and premeditated harvest” that we associate with the practice of gardening. And if this still seems too Edenic, Janzen explains that wildland “gardenification” is hard work: it involves “fencing, planting, fertilizing, tilling and weeding .... bioremediation, reforestation, afforestation, fire control, proscribed burning, crowd control, biological control, reintroduction, mitigation and much more.” To prove his point, Janzen and his partner Winnie Hallwachs, along with local communities have, over the course of their lifetimes, created a 165,000 hectare garden of thriving biodiversity in Costa Rica’s Area de’ Conservacion Guanacaste.</p>	
					<p>
					Janzen is first and foremost a biologist but he has described this remarkable project as “a de facto act of landscape architecture.” Importantly, Janzen’s ‘garden’ breaks with certain landscape architectural traditions: it is not an idyllic scene painted for contemplation of sweet nature, nor is it rid of people and contained within a fence. Janzen’s garden is a porous, working landscape, a constant work in progress. It is a model for the broader landscapes of the Anthropocene.</p>
					<a href='#top'>top</a>
				</div>
				<div id='protected'>
					<h3>Protected Areas</h3>
					<p>As Janzen’s garden attests, the ‘end of nature’ also announces the end of a certain scientific and romantic idealization of ecosystems as inherently inclined toward equilibrium and best kept free of humans. The new paradigm in ecology, as ecologist Robert Cook explains, is one in which ecosystems are understood as inherently chaotic and humans are accepted as a ‘natural’ part of both their history and future. For Cook, this new paradigm “challenges any clean distinction between culture and nature.”</p>
					<p>			
					With that in mind, if the walled medieval city of the Civitates is an anachronism in regard to today’s planetary urbanism and if the new paradigm of ecology includes humans, then we can surely argue that the ‘fortress conservation’ of protected areas is also anachronistic. This is not to say we shouldn't protect areas that are big enough to truly buffer against long term extinctions, it is to recognize that isolated enclaves free of human activity reinforce a conceptual divide between culture and nature at a time when those two referents no longer exist apart from one another. More practically, rarefied protected areas can distract us from the novel ecology of the broader landscape in which their glorious isolation is suspended. In this regard, Dan Brockington, Rosaleen Duffy and Jim Igoe in their critical study of how the major conservation NGOs are courting neo-liberal capitalism warn that “[u]ndue attention to wilderness risks blinding people to the value of used and modified lands. It also promotes an ethic in which the only landscapes worth saving are those that are distant and exotic, while landscapes that are proximate and mundane appear unworthy of our concern.”</p>	
					<p>
					Indeed, even though this Atlas marks the end of Ortelius’s world where unlimited resources could be harvested without consequence we can not be so naive as to think we have simply learned our ecological lesson and that now, through the proliferation of the world’s protected areas, ‘nature’ is safeguarded from capitalism’s creative destruction. Firstly, as we have discussed that nature no longer exists per se. Secondly, already devastated by the last 450 years of English, European and American colonization the world’s remaining biodiversity, often in remote Sth American, Asian and African regions is under further waves of pressure from ascendant industrial economies such as China. Thirdly, neo-liberal capitalism is finding new and not yet well-understood ways of commodifying and profiteering from nature not as an extractable resource but as a global “service provider”. This is what Bram Buscher Wolfram Dessler and Robert Fletcher describe so succinctly as NatureTM Inc. As they explain it NatureTM Inc “sells novel relations between humans and nonhuman natures...[t]his frontier traverses and connects the boardrooms of global hedge funds, trees owned by small farmers, consumers, interest groups, giant nature reserves, and a myriad of species (both human and non human) trying to survive in changing ecologies. It boasts grand images of pristine landscapes connected to often contradictory material realities and consequences leaving some actors struggling to access new markets and others dispossessed by various “green grabs”.</p>
					<p>
					As with any historical reworking of the concept of nature the reorganization of land-use boundaries follows and uneven power relations are inscribed. Whilst conservation cannot, - as its critics point out- escape socio-economic accountability just by virtue of its valorization of ‘nature’, let us also not forget who is overwhelmingly the victim here. For whilst critics are right to trace and expose the subjugation of local cultures that certain global conservation practices can and have in the past affected, this is not -strictly speaking- the end of the world for those humans: it is however most certainly the end for the litany of species that continue to come between us and our self-appointed prerogative of total environmental control. Its troubling reduction and representation of nature as an image, a vacation experience or an offset investment opportunity notwithstanding, if a neo- liberal conservation landscape has a lower extinction rate than its extractive predecessor then a neo-Marxist critique of “conservation as development” is not so straightforward.</p>	
					<p>
					When we began this research in early 2013, the world’s terrestrial protected area total was hovering at 13.5% of global terrestrial area. More recent figures suggest a total of around 15.4%; that is, 20.6 million square kilometers across 209,429 different sites in 235 different countries. This means that to reach the CBD’s 2020 target of 17%, an additional 1.6% of the world’s terrestrial area needs to be secured. This amount might, on first impression, seem paltry but 1.6% of the earth’s terrestrial surface is 2,327,800 km2, the equivalent of 695,835 Central Parks. That’s a Central Park with a length of 2,783,343 million kilometers (at 0.8 km wide) stretching 70 times around the world!</p>
					<p>			
					While some will see it as a pyrrhic victory and others will accuse the BINGOS (big non-government organizations) of neocolonialism, in 2020 as a fitting climax to the United Nations’ Decade of Biodiversity the CBD will no doubt celebrate the gains in the protected estate since the convention’s launch in 1992. But as it does so, two other challenges that the CBD set for itself in the Aichi Targets, will probably be downplayed. The first is the stipulation that protected areas can’t just be anywhere – they should be representative of the world’s 867 ecoregions. According to the CBD, this requires nations to ensure that “protected area systems...contain adequate samples of the full range of existing ecosystems and ecological processes, including at least 10% of each ecoregion within the country.” In some cases, particularly in hotspots, it is not possible to protect what doesn't exist and in those cases the CBD asks parties to restore at least 15% of their degraded ecosystems.</p>
					<p>
					The second stipulation is that protected areas should not be isolated fragments but connected to form continuous landscape matrices. This is important to enable gene flow over both the short and long term, particularly as species seek to adapt to climate change by moving toward new climes. 
					</p>

					<h3>Representative and Connected</h3>
					<p>Judging by the considerable proliferation of protected areas in recent years, global representation of ecoregions where stocks of endemic habitat exist but are not currently protected seems plausible (if not by 2020 then at some time hence). But just setting aside tracts of land to reach conservation targets does not necessarily mean that biodiversity is being represented or safeguarded. The question of quality versus quantity is pervasive and its assessment requires forensic scientific monitoring in addition to the relatively coarse grain monitoring by satellite GIS mapping and aerial imaging. The United Nations Environment Program’s 2014 Protected Planet Report states that only 29% of the area of nationally designated protected areas has been assessed for the effectiveness of their management regimes and in 2014 the CBD concluded “the element of Target 11 on conserving 17 per cent of terrestrial areas by 2020 is likely to be met globally, although protected area networks remain ecologically unrepresentative and many critical sites for biodiversity are poorly conserved”.</p>
					<p>				
					Achieving the CBD’s aim of landscape connectivity between otherwise isolated protected areas is even more challenging than achieving representation. The CBD openly states that “today’s protected areas will not be adequate to conserve many species whose distributions will shift in the future due to climate change.” Additionally, the 2014 Protected Planet Report states “we have little knowledge of the level of connectivity between conservation areas across the wider landscapes and seascapes.”</p>
					<p>	
					Connectivity requires that robust ecological corridors of appropriate dimension in both length and breadth be negotiated and constructed through landscapes typically dominated by incompatible, not to say hostile, land uses. As the map on page xx shows there are a plethora of large-scale connectivity projects being proposed or underway around the world—a remarkable historical turn of events in and of itself—but many of these are in Alpine and/or remote areas with significant extant wildland ‘stepping stones’ and relatively few competing land-use pressures.</p>
					<p>		
					The challenge of designating and then constructing finer-grained greenways through existing mosaics of agricultural, industrial and urbanized landscapes so that they function with any ecological integrity is an especially difficult technical, political and economic issue requiring an holistic reappraisal of land-use in any given region. Pre-eminent in this regard is the Netherlands where landscape architects and landscape ecologists have been actively planning and constructing a national ecological network of protected areas with “robust corridors” since 1990. This national initiative is supported by a ‘defragmentation plan,’ which addresses the specifics of how ecological corridors transcend jurisdictional boundaries and physical impediments. Although small, post-industrial, rich and culturally inclined towards such rational planning, the Dutch example is exemplary because it is about reorganizing an entirely novel, national ecosystem so that urbanism, agriculture and biodiversity can coexist in a mutually beneficial manner. The world’s hotspots, the focus of this Atlas, are however are a long way from the Netherlands.</p>
					<p>	
					According to the 2014 Protected Planet Report in 2014, 92% of parties to the CBD had developed National Biodiversity Strategies and Action Plans (NBSAPs). However, unlike the Dutch (who not only have a national, well-financed plan, but also a plan that is nested within the superstructure of the Pan European Ecological Network), an overwhelming majority of the 195 nations who are party to the CBD 2020 targets have no (publicly available) semblance of spatial planning. And where they do, they tend to simply consist of thick green lines or fuzzy airbrushed zones superimposed over maps at a scale so big as to be meaningless.

					<h3>Hotspots</h3>
					<p>Because we are primarily interested in how policy manifests in landscape form, our research zooms in on Aichi Targets 11, 15 and 17. The research question with which we began was what is the difference between the global target of 17% and what is actually is actually on the ground and to what degree are protected areas ecologically representative and well connected? Whilst these questions apply equally to all the world’s 8XX ecoregions, within the limits of feasibility we elected to focus the questions on the world’s biological hotspots as a matter of priority.</p>
					<p>
					Together, the hotspots contain at least 50% of the world’s total plant species and 42% of the world’s terrestrial vertebrates as endemic. The original and unique habitat in these hotspots is at least 70% depleted and is under imminent threat of total destruction due to habitat fragmentation related to urbanization, agriculture, and related economic activities. Originally representing 16% of the Earth’s surface, the unique habitat of the hotspots has diminished to just 2.3%. Consequently, conservation funding, research and activism have primarily focused on the urgency of preserving this biodiversity to reduce the risk of extinction of “more than half of our natural heritage.” Comprising xx of the world’s languages the world’s hotspots are also remarkable for their human diversity, a vital clue perhaps to our intertwined fates.</p>
					<p>
					In the world’s 35 biodiversity hotspots, insofar as we can tell only 12 of the 104 nations that preside over this territory have spatial plans for large-scale ecological networks. The reasons for this are no doubt many but certainly wordy reports replete with platitudes on biodiversity are less controversial than maps. But the lack of spatial planning in hotspots to meet the Aichi targets is not only an indictment of government, it also highlights the conspicuous absence of landscape architects from these territories. Not to put too fine a point on it the profession that claims to steward the earth is not there where the earth most desperately needs stewarding.</p>
					<p>	
					In each ecoregion in the hotspots we undertake a simple calculation of the shortfall between what is on the ground (according to GIS as of 2013 according to the IUCN protection categories 1 to 6) and the global CBD target of 17% protected areas. As noted above, the CBD’s Aichi Targets are for 10% representation or 15% reconstruction, whereas we are applying the global 17% target to each ecoregion. We are not suggesting this policy setting is right for each ecoregion, we are using it as a reasonable benchmark to cut across the hotspots consistently and frame the degree to which different regions and nations are meeting their obligations under the CBD. Our calculations show that XXX of the ecoregions fall well short of the 17% target and XX fall short of a 10% target. This is corroborated by the 2014 Protected Planet Report which states that: “[p] rotected areas [PAs] do not sufficiently cover areas of particular importance for biodiversity (only 22–23% are completely covered by PAs), and many terrestrial and marine ecoregions are still poorly represented. Targeted expansion of protected area networks is needed to include these key areas on the land, and especially the seas. More than 17% of the land and 10% of the sea will need to be protected to meet this element of the target.”</p>
					<p>
					In comparison to the amount of existing protected area in each ecoregion, we highlight the amount of land that is neither protected nor evidently subject to monocultural agricultural production. These extensive (light green) areas are lands that Erle Ellis refers to as “the remnant, recovering, and managed novel ecosystems formed by land use and its legacies ... the predominant form of terrestrial ecosystems today and into the future.” It is in these weedy, feral territories that the fate of much of the world’s biodiversity will be decided. These are the scrappy lands into which biodiversity is being forced, across which it must traverse and to which it must ultimately adapt. These are the land we need to manage.</p>

				<div id='biodiversity'>
					<h3>Biodiversity</h3>
					<p>Certainly biodiversity’s bloody front line is often in remote landscapes but in the age of planetary urbanism we can no longer think of biodiversity as only ‘out there’. Tied in complicated feedback loops, ‘city’ and ‘landscape’ are reciprocally the cause and effect of our ecological crisis. As such, conservation is an issue that cuts from the core of our densest cities to the furthest wilds. Although it is not yet well monitored, it is increasingly appreciated that the metabolism of the contemporary city, no matter how divorced it might feel, is interconnected with the sources and sinks of the broader landscape at all points. Environmental stewardship, then, is as much a matter of urban design is it is landscape ecology. As Herbet Giradet insists, “[t]here will be no sustainable world without sustainable cities.”</p>
					<p>				
					It is no mistake then that indicative publications are now starting to treat biodiversity and urbanity as coupled subjects under the rubric of urban ecology. For example, the conclusion to the recent Global Assessment of Urbanization, Biodiversity and Ecosystems Services report stresses that cities are central to the larger agenda of environmental stewardship. “As centers of human innovation, and perhaps the most active frontier of our impact on the planet in shaping its landscapes and seascapes, cities offer arenas for enormous opportunities to reimagine and invent a different kind of future with room for humans and other species to thrive. Cities may well be the ground where we secure a globally sustainable future—one that builds on nature-based solutions and ecosystem-based adaptation, and establishes responsible environmental stewardship at the heart of public interest.”</p>
					<p>			
					The conversion of cities from wasteful, destructive machines to ecologically sophisticated organisms is surely the greatest creative challenge of the 21st century and beyond, but to do this, the city must be conceived of and analyzed not as an object set against nature’s backdrop but as a bottleneck in local, regional and global ecological flows. For this reason, as well as mapping the 4xx ecoregions of the world’s biodiversity hotspots we have also included a cursory analysis of the 185 major cities that exist within them.</p>
					<p>		
					Whereas the cities collected in the Civitates were all tightly contained, the 414 cities in the world’s biodiversity hotspots are sprawling rampantly with both formal and informal growth. The way we have mapped each of these cities is to overlay their (2030) projected growth trajectories with existing landscape and biodiversity conditions to identify zones of immanent conflict between their growth and extant habitat. This suggests that the arts and sciences of urban planning and design should be brought to bear with particular acuity on these flashpoints, but more than that, these cities require whole-of-city studies to analyze their biophysical stocks and flows as well as their cultural relationships with their (eco)regional landscapes. For just as individuals can steward or degrade a piece of land, cities can steward or degrade their regions.</p>
					<p>
					By focusing on the world’s hotspots our intention with this Atlas is not to re-present nature’s pin- ups or frame ‘her’ as the victim yet again, rather we are motivated their exceptional scientific and cultural significance in the global biological order of things and argue for their entire landscapes— including their cities—to be subject to properly funded long-term, planning and design studies. Universities around the world, particularly those with landscape architecture programs can amalgamate interdisciplinary teams to work with conservationists, local communities and governments in an effort to build up design and planning intelligence in these regions.</p>
					<p>		
					The landscape of the future that landscape architects work toward is one in which megaregional urban networks and bioregional ecological networks are carefully interwove. In his book Urban Green: Architecture for the Future, Neil Chambers brings this image to life; the goal he says, “[w]ould be to have revitalized region[s] support tens of millions of people while producing natural niches for multiple ecosystems of native plants and animals to flourish and abound, where agriculture, infrastructure, and power production is integrated into nature in a way that enriches rivers, forests, economics, and communities... Biologists, engineers, ecologists, architects, zoologists, designers, hydrologists, and a host of other disciplines would need to work together to restore multiple eco-zones.”</p>
					<p>
					Technology and human nature are never quite so rational and so benign, but Chambers’ optimistic vision that human agency can be a constructive rather than destructive part of ecoregions is the philosophical prerequisite for new material practices. This is precisely what McHarg meant by ‘design with nature’, it is what Lovelock means by a practice of ‘planetary medicine’ and what Janzen means by ‘gardenification.’</p>

					<h3>On Maps and Mapping</h3>
					<p>“Brought to the negotiating table at the right moment a well produced map can swing a decision, change a park boundary or even better stop an eviction. Maps therefore, are threatening not only to government authorities only to extractive corporations, colonial land titles, and yes, at times to conservationists.”</p>
					<p>			
					“Maps are the perfect graphic emblems of reductionism”. Stephen S. Hall in ‘The Mapmakers by John Noble Wilford. In his sweeping historical survey of mapping ‘Cartographia’, Vincent Virga explains that maps are by definition “a selective graphic representation, implying that the cartographer exercises a certain amount of judgment and bias, no matter how scientific the presentation purports to be”. Through examples Virga identifies no less than 134 different polemical purposes to which maps have lent themselves over time. These range from “map as subversive urban utopia” to “map as permutations of desire” or “map as nation’s psyche” and so on. Remarkably, however, of the 134 ideological types he identifies (these are listed on page XX) and the 201 maps shown as evidence, only one - a map of a small part of the Great Barrier Reef in Australia- is even remotely ‘environmental’ in purpose. Like maps so often are themselves, Varga’s taxonomy is in this sense revealing for what it leaves out. But the point is not so much that the ecological crisis, surely the preeminent subject of our times, is under represented in Varga’s account of cartographic history but that, put together, history’s maps seem to have unwittingly but inexorably led us so boldly and blindly into today’s landscapes of crisis. The question this Atlas asks then is whether new maps can get us out?</p>
					<p>					
					In his book ‘To the Ends of the Earth: 100 Maps that Changed the World’ Jeremy Harwood makes up for the environmental lacuna in Varga’s survey by devoting the last 4 of his 100 selections to the late 20th century digital revolution in cartography. Over 2000 satellites (known collectively and colloquially as Global Information Systems: GIS) now whirl silently (at 28,000 km s per hour) around the earth fixing virtually everything in their electromagnetic, pixelated gaze. The subject of this cyborgian, perpetual-mapping-machine is not only where things are in space, but more importantly how things change over time. Because the environmental crisis is generally a question of understanding what is changing where, we can say that with remote sensing and its data- streams we have entered not only the apocalyptic age of star wars and the white-noise world of global telecommunications, but more optimistically, the age of ecological cartography.</p>
					<p>					
					The ecological cartography contained in this Atlas comes in 3 very general forms. The first are a series of world maps, the second are of the world’s 35 hotspots and their constituent eco-regions, and the third are of rapidly growing cities within those ecoregions. Of their time and technology, the maps are entirely sourced from Global Information Systems. Like Ortelius’ first Atlas we have sourced all our information not from direct experience but from secondary sources; individuals and organizations who have made their research freely available. We have taken the data to be true as given and have simply cleaned it and filtered it so as to clarify and highlight a particular subject. The subject of each of the world maps is self-evident; soils, nuclear facilities etcetera; the subject of the hotspot maps and ecoregions is exclusively the amount of remnant habitat in each (explained below) and the subject of the city maps is the identification of where each city’s projected 2030 growth is on a collision course with remnant habitat.</p>
					<p>			
					The “judgment and bias” of this Atlas lies firstly in our acceptance of the data provided through GIS as a reasonable basis for map making in the age of ecological cartography; secondly in our foregrounding of each map’s particular thematic to the exclusion of all others, and finally in the way that a collection of ostensibly neutral and factual maps is combined to form an Atlas that, by implication, raises prescient questions of land-use on a global scale.

					<h3>The World Maps link to World Maps</h3>
					<p>“Cartography is never merely about the drawing of maps: it is the making of worlds.”</p>
					<p>				
					The world maps take single or sometimes coupled themes and highlight the geographic distribution of that theme. For the purposes of cross-referencing each theme to the overarching issue of biodiversity, the 35 hotspots are notated on every world map. Without trying to be encyclopedic or compete with orthodox atlases we have determined the list of thematic world maps and datascapes by choosing topics we believe to be pertinently connected to the general issue of global biodiversity. A short text adjacent to each map explains the map’s theme and, where appropriate, alludes to its limitations and or the need for further research. The datascapes (xx – xx) depart somewhat from global mapping and focus on illustrating certain quantities (solar energy, carbon emissions for example).Datascapes do this by accurately scaling the quantity of a certain subject against a recognizable referent.</p>
					<p>			
					Just as determining the themes for the world maps is a curatorial question so too is which projection to use in unfolding the three dimensional earth onto two-dimensional plane. Since Ptolemy (c C.E. 150) first attempted it, projection has been the bane of cartography. Because every map is a projection of a sphere (and the earth is not a perfect sphere) onto a plane; every map must inherently have some sort of distortion. This distortion can be of distance, direction, shape, or area. A certain projection – and there are now over 200 to choose from) can preserve one of these qualities at the expense of the others.</p>
					<p>
					Because cartographic representation is “about making worlds” different projections are associated with different cultural and ideological implications. The Mercator projection, dating from 1569 holds Europe at the center and puffs up the developed world; it lowers the equator and turns Greenland into a behemoth rivaling Africa. For these reasons it is seen by some as a recapitulation of the era of Eurocentric imperialism from which it was originally borne. Despite its critics, however the Mercator projection does a relatively good job of evenly representing the equatorial regions and it in those regions that the world’s biological hotspots predominate.</p>
					<p>		
					In the 20th century, various projections were created to replace the Mercator. Notably, Gall Stereographic, Robinson, Eckert IV, Fuller, and Goode Homolosine all have their advantages and disadvantages. Touted as a postmodern alternative to Mercator has been the Peters projection, created by Dr Arno Peters in 1973. The Peters projection is faithful to area and thus claimed to rectify Mercator’s wrong but as it did so it stretched the continents, so much so that its critics described this politically correct world as looking like wet underwear hung on a line. Whilst one side of politics welcomed this as the end of an era, cartographers were quick to point out that it too was an ideologically motivated distortion.</p>
					<p>				
					Most Atlases choose the Winkel tripel projection, but in this atlas we have chosen the Goode Homolosine as our mainstay. Although it comes in segments and warps at its edges, the homolosine lays out the world most generously and proportionately across 2 pages. In some cases, for clarity of communication of a particular theme we defer to the Mercator or the Winkel and do so with no ideological intent.</p>
					<p>					
					If debates about projection seem antiquated it is because projecting a dynamic world as static two-dimensional images in books is itself antiquated. Every map is by definition out-of-date from the very moment it is drafted. As we move into an age of global positioning systems (GPS), remote sensing and real time visualization with the increasingly ability to cheaply stream data to personal computers the old problem of translating the 3rd dimension in to the second will largely absolve itself. Indeed, mapping’s future - what we are here calling ‘ecological cartography’ - lies not in the static imagery of the 2nd dimension but in the temporal flow of the 4th. As such the bigger project that this (antiquarian) Atlas points to is a web-based platform that tracks the evolution of the world’s biodiversity hotspots, if not all the worlds 8XX ecoregions in real time, for all to see.</p>

					<h3>The Hotspot Maps</h3>
					<p>Mapping in general and Atlas’s in particular pride themselves on accuracy and whilst we have stayed true to the sources, in the case of ever-changing environmental phenomena maps are only as good as their most recent update. The protected area mapping upon which the Hotspot maps and the ecoregion maps are based is from 2013 GIS files. Protected areas have increased by around 2% globally since then but only a small proportion of that increase is in the hotspots. In broad terms the relationship shown between CBD protected area targets and what is actually on the ground in both the hotspot maps and the ecoregion maps will remain valid, albeit at a coarse grain of resolution, for years to come.</p>
					<p>				
					The method for determine the difference between current allocations of protected areas and the Aichi targets is that eco-regions are first isolated and extracted within a given hotspot using the GIS “clipping” tool. This creates a new subset of eco-region shapefiles that only contain the area located within a hotspot’s perimeter. While eco-regions often span multiple geographic or national boundaries, we have elected to focus on individual hotspots as study sites. Protected areas are isolated through a similar clipping method, using the individual eco-regions as an outline instead of the hotspot as a whole. The protected areas can then be compressed into a new “shape” with an area that may be calculated in GIS. This requires setting a spatial projection for the map (we have used WGS 1984 World Mercator).</p>
					<p>				
					Determination of what we refer to as remnant vegetation begins with a rasterized depiction of land cover classifications on a high-resolution pixelated image. The raster is converted into a shapefile (vector), and specific layers (agriculture, barren, water/ice, urban) are removed. The remaining lands are theoretically viable habitat, or areas that can be easily restored to create viable habitat without significant destruction to developed areas or food systems. Importantly, we “correct” the remnant vegetation value derived from our GIS analysis by first subtracting any overlapping protected areas. This ensures that only non-protected viable lands are included in our analysis. The remnant vegetation is then clipped by the eco-region outlines, and compressed in order to calculate its area. In this study, we have used 17 per cent protection as the primary Aichi target for all shortfall calculations, including ‘Percent Shortfall’ and ‘Area of the Shortfall’. These values are re-drawn at the same scale as the original map, in order to demonstrate the land area within a given hotspot that must be protected to meet the target, and how much viable habitat remains in which to do so. At the Hotspot scale we looked at the IUCN categories 1-4 (dark green) next to categories 5-6 (light green).</p>
					<a href='#top'>top</a>
				</div>
				<div id='ecoregion'>
					<h3>The Ecoregion Maps</h3>
					<p>At the Ecoregion scale we mapped all IUCN categories 1-6 at a much more detailed resolution (but in the same dark green- so they are not distinguishable). This was next to what we called "remnant habitat" (light green) which was extrapolated from the non cultivated/ non urban land use on maps from the Institute of Environment and Sustainability at the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission We used all categories with the idea in mind that the more lax categories (5-6) were more likely to gain stricter protection with policy changes, and that we wanted to find a more detailed spatial framework for connecting these areas across a larger territory. In many cases 5-6 areas are already connected to 1-4, so this logic projects that the protection could easily expand its scope. Not sure that conclusions at this point go beyond the idea that a number of ecoregions are not protected to the full 17% target but that there generally is potential to expand and connect (at least at this level of resolution). I'm interested in figuring out a means for protection across these ecoregions that actually does improve connectivity- in many cases the ecoregions are so small and so isolated, that connection doesn't seem plausible or sometimes even necessary (mangrove to montane? not sure). The other idea- that some ecoregions have reached the targets- but they may need to expand protection in order to increase connectivity. It might be beneficial to organize the ecoregions into their larger biome categories or better draw out their relationships geographically...</p>
					<p>					
					“...there also problems with the quality of the data.</p>
					<p>		
					First it is unable to detect agro-forestry, such as shade grown coffee. It could also not distinguish between fallowed land growing trees and unused land. Moreover since agricultural activity was defined as areas with at least 30 per cent of land under crops it thus omits less intensive cultivation. It gives no indication of pastoral use of rangelands...”</p>

				<div id='conflict_maps'>
					<h3>The Conflict Maps</h3>
					<p>In the world’s biodiversity hotspots there are 414 urban agglomerations, or in a more comprehensive term to be referred to from here on as cities. Populations of 300,000 people or more defines cities, according to United Nations’ World Urbanization Prospects: The 2014 Revision. In terms of impact on biodiversity this cut off is somewhat arbitrary; in fact, each hotspot requires a complete inventory of its urbanity and related infrastructure as an interconnected system. Here, however we establish a point of departure to further study by collecting these cities and scrutinizing where their forecast growth is likely to compete with remnant peri-urban habitat.</p>
					<p>
					The growth area data projected out to 2030 is from the Seto Lab at Yale. The growth projections are derived through two phases as Karen Seto and her team explained:</p>
					<p>					
					“The forecasts are developed in two phases. In the first phase, for each region we generate 1,000 estimates of aggregate amount of urban expansion by randomly drawing 1,000 values each from the corresponding probability density functions (PDFs) of projected GDP and urban population. We use the uncertainty ranges in population and GDP projections to estimate thecorresponding PDFs. In the second phase, we use the aggregate amounts and simulate their spatial distribution using a spatially explicit grid-based landchange model (44), which uses slope, distance to roads, population density, and land cover as the primary drivers of land change. Our analysis assumes no new road development. Significant changes in road development would change the spatial patterns but not the amount of new urban expansion.” (Seto, Güneralp, and Hutyra, 2012).</p>
					<p>			
					The result is a raster grid map of the world, with a spatial resolution of 5km by 5km grid cell size. Each grid possesses a possibility of urbanization in percentage, which is calculated using the above method. We have extracted those that have a possibility of 50% or higher to become urbanized as the Atlas’ growth projection zone. These urban growth projections are then overlaid on remnant vegetation data (Global Land Cover Facility) and IUCN Red List species habitats for 3,245 species that are either critically endangered or endangered (2 categories out of 7) . This operation generated the broad brush identification of areas where the urban sprawl (both formal and informal) is pushing against and into valuable biodiversity habitat. These maps draw attention to places in need of urban design strategies to mitigate such flashpoints.</p>
